To answer the question of what is the most powerful thing I have learned throughout this course I would follow the journey in my notes in which I learned about the history of the telegraph to the internet.

- In class notes - Feb 1. The first note I would look at is the in class note I took February first. This was one of the first classes in the semester and as such it acts as a good beginning foundation for which a lot of the knowledge I have now sprouted from. Detailed in the excerpt from the note above is where Jean Antoin's leyden jar experiments was first inroduced to me. Prior to this lesson I had done no research on the history of carrying currents when electricty was first discovered and as such it worked as a great stepping to stone to keep looking into the history of carrying electric current and subsequently carrying the signals we use to transmit the modern internet.

- Telegraphs - This next note is where I take another step forward into the history of carrying current and messages and look at the Telegraph. The passage above comes from an atomic note for the telegraph and features the common defintion for them which first appeared in [[Memex 1 - Source note 4]]. Everyone knows about telegraphs, however,  not many people are aware of the history surrounding them. I was part of that many aswell before the lesson of February 13th. I imagined that the transition into telgraphs and then intor telephones was a smooth one as all the technologies are incredibly convienient and commonplace in the modern world. Learning about the history of telegraphs changed that.

- ![[Samuel Morse#^3f5f75]]
- Samuel Morse - This is another atomic note that stems from the atomic telegraph note above. Along with the development of telegraphs came the creation of morse code, the coding language used in telegraphed messages. Morse code is still one of, if not the most used coding languages in the modern world. Contrary to popular belief though Samuel Morse did not invent the telegraph, rather he just made improvements to the design and realized that the pulses of electricity that could be transmitted over the lines could convey a message.

- In class notes - Feb 13, this note follows a deeper history of telegraphs and in particular the diffuclties that came with setting up the intial launch of the telegraph infrastructure. The excerpt from the note above really works to highlight the unknown history of telegraphs which I mentioned in reference to the telegraph atomic note. Although it seems as though telegraphs should have been a priority and a no brainer to invest in, the government was reluctant as they felt there was no social need for it. The only reason that telegraphs and subsequently telephones exist is because of the capitalistic desire to have more trains on tracks and they needed a new communication medium to do so.

- Memex 1 - Source note 3 - This note is written in relation to an article called *The Evolution of the Internet*. After looking into the history of the telegraph and how the first national and intercontinental networks were set up, looking at the modern day internet networks and how those came to be sets up a historical contrast that can be observed. The article *The Evolution of the Internet* talks largely about the beginning stages of the now great medium. Networks like DARPA which created the first packet switching networks can be compared to the telegraph. They can be can be compared in the sense that innovation was only inspired by social need. DARPA (Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency) was a military agency and packet switching networks provided an infinitely more secure and invincible network framework than the previous hub-and-spoke model. The modern internet is similar to the telegraph in the sense that its development still has its roots in military needs and capitalistic desires.

- Memex 3 - Source note 4 - This final note ends off the transition from telegraph to internet as it derives from the article *Before the Web There was Gopher* by Philip L. Frana. The article talks about another precursor to the internet Gopher which acted as a way that non-academics could use the internet. The reason this is the note I chose to end on is that Frana end the article in talking about how Gopher was replaced with the modern internet framework of WWW and thus is provides and actual conclusion to the development of the internet and large scale networks as we know now. The reason that I chose this series of notes as the most powerful thing I've learned throughout the course is that it raised my awareness about the internet and how software develops like nothing else has before. Looking at the internet and knowing how it is now and as revolutionary as it seems, because of these lessons and reading I know that this is exactly how everyone before my time felt when faced with their networks. Be it Gopher, Darpa or even telegraphs. Throughout the past year AI technologie has improved tenfold and is now in greater supply to the mass public. It has become another revolutionary technology and because of this class I feel as if we are witnessing the advent of another major tech period that will surpass the WWW.
