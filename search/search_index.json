The first note I would look at is the in class note I took February first. This was one of the first classes in the semester and as such it acts as a good beginning foundation for which a lot of the knowledge I have now sprouted from. Detailed in the excerpt from the note above is where Jean Antoin's leyden jar experiments was first inroduced to me. Prior to this lesson I had done no research on the history of carrying currents when electricty was first discovered and as such it worked as a great stepping to stone to keep looking into the history of carrying electric current and subsequently carrying the signals we use to transmit the modern internet.  -  - Telegraphs - This next note is where I take another step forward into the history of carrying current and messages and look at the Telegraph. The passage above comes from an atomic note for the telegraph and features the common defintion for them which first appeared in Memex 1 - Source note 4. Everyone knows about telegraphs, however,  not many people are aware of the history surrounding them. I was part of that many aswell before the lesson of February 13th. I imagined that the transition into telgraphs and then intor telephones was a smooth one as all the technologies are incredibly convienient and commonplace in the modern world. Learning about the history of telegraphs changed that. - #telegraphs - All relevant pages that touch on telegraphs or thier history in some way. -  - Samuel Morse - This is another atomic note that stems from the atomic telegraph note above. Along with the development of telegraphs came the creation of morse code, the coding language used in telegraphed messages. Morse code is still one of, if not the most used coding languages in the modern world. Contrary to popular belief though Samuel Morse did not invent the telegraph, rather he just made improvements to the design and realized that the pulses of electricity that could be transmitted over the lines could convey a message. - website/In class notes/ - In class notes - Feb 13, this note follows a deeper history of telegraphs and in particular the diffuclties that came with setting up the intial launch of the telegraph infrastructure. The excerpt from the note above really works to highlight the unknown history of telegraphs which I mentioned in reference to the telegraph atomic note. Although it seems as though telegraphs should have been a priority and a no brainer to invest in, the government was reluctant as they felt there was no social need for it. The only reason that telegraphs and subsequently telephones exist is because of the capitalistic desire to have more trains on tracks and they needed a new communication medium to do so.  - website/In class notes/ - Memex 1 - Source note 3 - This note is written in relation to an article called The Evolution of the Internet. After looking into the history of the telegraph and how the first national and intercontinental networks were set up, looking at the modern day internet networks and how those came to be sets up a historical contrast that can be observed. The article The Evolution of the Internet talks largely about the beginning stages of the now great medium. Networks like DARPA which created the first packet switching networks can be compared to the telegraph. They can be can be compared in the sense that innovation was only inspired by social need. DARPA (Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency) was a military agency and packet switching networks provided an infinitely more secure and invincible network framework than the previous hub-and-spoke model. The modern internet is similar to the telegraph in the sense that its development still has its roots in military needs and capitalistic desires.  - #internet - All relevant pages which relate to the internet and its history. - website/source notes/Memex 3/ - Memex 3 - Source note 4 - This final note ends off the transition from telegraph to internet as it derives from the article Before the Web There was Gopher by Philip L. Frana. The article talks about another precursor to the internet Gopher which acted as a way that non-academics could use the internet. The reason this is the note I chose to end on is that Frana end the article in talking about how Gopher was replaced with the modern internet framework of WWW and thus is provides and actual conclusion to the development of the internet and large scale networks as we know now. The reason that I chose this series of notes as the most powerful thing I've learned throughout the course is that it raised my awareness about the internet and how software develops like nothing else has before. Looking at the internet and knowing how it is now and as revolutionary as it seems, because of these lessons and reading I know that this is exactly how everyone before my time felt when faced with their networks. Be it Gopher, Darpa or even telegraphs. Throughout the past year AI technologie has improved tenfold and is now in greater supply to the mass public. It has become another revolutionary technology and because of this class I feel as if we are witnessing the advent of another major tech period that will surpass the WWW.</p>"},{"location":"0_Final%20Journey_2/","title":"0 Final Journey 2","text":"<p>I wanted to get a deeper understanding of how the internet formed and how that affected the people of that time.

These notes come up again as it reflects a similar message as the question what is the most powerful thing I have learned in this course. The reason that I find them a part of the most powerful things I have learned is because they help to contribute to my initial goals in taking the course. I wanted to see how the internet and networks as a whole contributed to the social spheres that they were apart of. In the in class note from February 13th we learned about that exactly that relation in reference to the telegraph. I was able to learn about why the telegraph was not initially wanted by the people of its time as well as learning about how innovation only normally comes when there is a social need for it. In source note 4 for memex 3 we are able to see how the Gopher system for the internet was influencial to its social sphere in enabling those outside of academia to have access to the internet and on a grander scale how people were able to see the development of what would become a world shaking invention. To conclude, as a whole I would say that as a whole I was able to accomplish what I wanted from the course, while I wish more of the material covered was about that direct relation ship from internet to the people using it. The notes above provide enough information for me to feel as If what I wanted from the course was completed. </li> </ul>"},{"location":"0_Final%20Journey_2/#luigigalvani-all-notes-to-do-with-italian-physician-luigi-galvani","title":"LuigiGalvani - All notes to do with Italian physician Luigi Galvani.","text":""},{"location":"0_Final%20Journey_2/#internet-all-notes-to-do-with-the-internet-and-its-history","title":"internet - All notes to do with the internet and its history.","text":""},{"location":"Features/LaTeX%20Math%20Support/","title":"LaTeX Math Support","text":"<p>LaTeX math is supported using MathJax.</p> <p>Inline math looks like \\(f(x) = x^2\\).

Coopersmith describes the fax's existence as \"supply outpacing demand\" it was a product that was designed for a market to small to schieve success. Faxing was a more costly and less efficient way of transmitting messages which meant that event at the height of its popularity it was still being outclassed by comepting technologies who would work better and for less. However, despite all of its failures in the 1980's standardization came about and the fax machine was suddenly in demand shocking advocates for the new digital technologies.

SIgnals that travelled through the cable would attenuate meaning that engineers needed to incorporate a way to boost the signal along its path in order to maintain a strong connection. </p> <p>Another thing Muller touches on is the impact that the cable had on global communication and its cultural significance to the world. What the cables did was connect the world in a way that had never been done before. Before the cable was laid, communication between the americas and europe would take weeks or months. With the transatlantic telegraph cable communication could be accomplished almost instantaniously. This shift changed peoples perspective about the world and made people think of it as a smaller more interconneced place.  </p>"},{"location":"source%20notes/Memex%203/Memex%203%20-%20Source%20note%202/","title":"Memex 3   Source note 2","text":"<p>Title: [Submarine Telegraph Cables: Business and Politics, 1838-1939] date: {{April 10}}</p> <p>tags:: #telegraphs #networking #morsecode #historyofnetworking #underseatelegraphs</p> <p>Reference Headrick, D.

Headrick and Pascal Griset write about the history of submarine telegraph cables. They talk about the development of the technology and the work of various entrepeneurs and governments to lay the cables accross the oceans (Samuel Morse, British, French and German Governments, and more). The main goal behind laying the cables was due to economic and political motivations (trade and military comunications) as well as competition between nation to establish telegraph supremacy. </p>"},{"location":"source%20notes/Memex%203/Memex%203%20-%20Source%20note%203/","title":"Memex 3   Source note 3","text":"<p>Title: [Anatomy of an AI System] date: {{date}}</p> <p>tags:: #internet #networking #historyofcode #historyofnetworking #AI</p> <p>Reference Crawford, K., &amp; Joler, V.

It details the social and environemental issues that surround Amazon's home system AI the Amazon Echo. The main environmetntal issue they propose is that the whole system from start to finish creates environmental harm. From the mining process in extracting the rare minerals required for its creation, the carbon emission that go along with that as well as the manufacturing process, and finally the waste from disposing of the Echo which  can result in more environmental harm if not done properly. </p> <p>They also delve into the data infrastructure that underlies in the Amazon Echo. The Amazon Echo is a voice activated assistant, meaning that the device is always listening whereever it is placed in the home. Furthermore, with the artificial intelligence installed in the machine, the machine learns the behaviour of the people around it. Crawford and Joler talk about the ways in which the Echo is embedded into the larger system of social and  environmental reltaionships and how the device does not stand on its own, but rather fits into a network of actors and processors that has implications for both Chinese labour conditions for where the factories are situated and energy consumption for whatever home they are found in. </p>"},{"location":"source%20notes/Memex%203/Memex%203%20-%20Source%20note%204/","title":"Memex 3   Source note 4","text":"<p>Title: [Before the Web There was Gopher] date: {{April 10}}</p> <p>tags:: #internet #networking #ARPANET #historyofnetworking </p> <p>Reference P.

It was a tool mainly used by researchers, however, With the introduction of Gopher \"non-experts\" were able to experience the internet. Frana talks about the features that the Gopher protocol had, those being a hierarchical menu of resources and the simple text based interface that would inspire the modern internet tool of hyperlinks. </p> <p>In the end, Frana talks about how Gopher was quickly replaced with the modern WWW as it was just in general a vastly improved internet medium. </p>"},{"location":"source%20notes/Memex%203/Memex%203%20-%20Source%20note%205/","title":"Memex 3   Source note 5","text":"<p>Title: [The Evolution of the Internet] date: {{April 11}}</p> <p>tags:: #internet #networking #historyofnetworking #historyofcode #computers #communication </p> <p>Reference [Author removed at request of original publisher].
